7. **Functionality Note:**

    - While the core functionalities will work after downloading the code, please note that the cookie-based features will not function as expected. This is because we utilized a professional third-party tool, iubenda, to manage cookies on the live site.

## Info
To ensure the correct functioning of all features, the website must be hosted on a server with an active internet connection.
